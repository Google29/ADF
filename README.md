# Python Exercises
1,Program to read a file and store the unique words in a list sorted based on the length of word in a new file along with each word length appended to it.

Creating the list name (one)(two) and creating a try block inside which opening a file in a write mode and storing it into a variable output file,inside which creating a another try block inside that opening an another text file in a read mode and spliting the text by space and storing it into a input file,When the count is 1,append the length of the word in list (one).Concatenate the length to the word and append it to the list (two).Sort the list (one).Append the words to output file based on the values in list (two).

2,Program to read a CSV (CSV with n number of columns) and store it in DICT of list.

Getting the input as file name and storing it in a variable named file,then opening the file in the read mode using open function,creating a list named (dict_list),using a method DictReader travering the file and appending the each line into the list (dict_list),then printing that list

3,Program to Print all Prime Numbers in an Interval of 5 seconds

Getting an maximum range of a digit for which prime has to be find into a variable (num) and then creating the list of size num filling it with True(boolean list),traversing through the list from two to end of the list, In that Falsing the statement which is the multiple of i,then coming out of the list therefore the non-prime number index in the list is false,we can take the True as a Prime, Includng the method (sleep,time) for getting Interval of 5s.

4,Program to Find HCF or GCD

Got an input of first digit into a variable (x),Got an input of second digit into a variable (y) and calling the method named gcd,inside the method (x,y=y,x%y),and returning x and then printing the value

5,Program to Convert Decimal to Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal

Got the input variable as integer,first using decimal to hexa function converted into a hexa value Logic is (num % 16 < 10),using decimal to octal function converted into a octal value Logic is "str(num % 8) + oct",using decimal to binary function converted into a binary digit Logic is (num % 2 == 0) it will coordinates 0 else 1. 

6,Program to Find ASCII Value of Character.

Got an input of character and stored in variable name (num), printing its ascii using ORD function.

7,Program to get an application (name , age , gender, salary, state, city)

Creating a class with a six instance variable,named(name , age , gender, salary, state, city) inside a method called Declare_employee,each method initializing the variable then using Print_employee printing all the attribute of class employee.
